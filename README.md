# 👋 Hi, I'm Gary

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a senior Computer Science major at the University of Central Florida with passion and experience for building scalable and globally deployable software. I specialize in developing end-to-end test suites, and DevOps capabilities like continuous integration pipelines and containerizing/scaling deployments of global applications.

## 🔥 Recent Projects
- [Carver Matrix](https://github.com/garyorsargos/carver-matrix) - Led the development of a containerized web application for U.S. Army Special Operations Command, digitizing the CARVER protocol to automate target defense rankings and save hours of coordination time.
- [Pegasus Parking](https://github.com/garyorsargos/pegasus-parking) - Built a location-based platform enabling UCF students to locate parking spaces according to their permits, featuring real-time availability through RESTful APIs.
